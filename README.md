# CS 5530 - Team "Front of the Class"

This is the repository for our team's CS 5530 project. The goal of this project is to create a text summarizer using deep learning. The model will be trained on a dataset of news articles and will be able to generate summaries for new articles.

## Dataset

The training dataset is a collection of news articles from 3 separate datasets (XSum, CNN/Daily Mail, Multi-News). The dataset contains 870,521 articles, each of which has a text content and a summary. The text content is the full article, and the summary is a short version of the article that summarizes the main points. 

The dataset is available [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sbhatti/news-summarization) and is licensed under a [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license. The dataset is also available on the [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail) library.

We do not include the dataset in this repository because it is too large. However, you can download the dataset from the links above and place it in the `data` directory.

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Unnamed: 0` - index, can be ignored
- `ID` - unique ID for each article (appears to be a generated UUID)
- `Content` - the text content of the article
- `Summary` - the summary of the article
- `Dataset` - the dataset that the article came from (XSum, CNN/Daily Mail, Multi-News)

## Training Process/Roadmap

This is a rough outline of the steps that we will take to train the model:

- **Phase 1 - Data Acquisition and Refinement** (see `phase_1.ipynb`)
    - [x] Obtain a dataset of news articles that includes the text content as well as a summary of each article. 
    - [ ] Explore the dataset to get a sense of the data, such as the number of articles, length of the articles and summaries, and distribution of topics and keywords.
    - [ ] Clean and preprocess the data to remove unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stop words. 
    - [ ] Tokenize the text into words or subwords, and create input sequences and output summaries.
- **Phase 2 - Model Architecture Selection** 
    - [ ] Choose a deep learning model that is suitable for the task of summarization. 
        - We will most likely go with a transformer-based model, such as BERT or T5.
        - However, we could also look into an encoder-decoder model or a pointer-generator network. 
    - [ ] Define the architecture of the model, including the number of layers, hidden units, and embedding dimensions.
- **Phase 3 - Model Training and Evaluation:** 
    - [ ] Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
    - [ ] Train the model on the training set and monitor its performance on the validation set. 
        - [ ] Use techniques like early stopping and learning rate annealing to prevent overfitting and improve performance. 
    - [ ] Evaluate the model on the test set to get a final estimate of its performance.
7. **Phase 4 - Iterative Improvements** 
    - [ ] Finally, analyze the performance of the model and identify areas for improvement. 
    - [ ] This could involve collecting more data, tuning hyperparameters, or experimenting with different architectures. 
    - [ ] Iterate through these steps until the model achieves satisfactory performance.
